Oh boy, our very first 'state of the website.' Well, as of my 64th production deploy, I can finally state that the website is *perfect*. No further changes necessary!

Is what I wish I could say. But in the wise words of RocketSnail, world famous developer known for their work on Club Penguin, there's always more bugs to squash. And let me assure you, the nanobots I've hired to maintain this shithole are trying their very best to do so. And you should know they've been working hard indeed since I've started paying them in YacksonCoin™, further details coming soon. And while we wait for their hard work to come to fruition, let us enjoy the progress we've made thus far.

As you can see, the basic housekeeping is done. Headers, layout, comments, *vibes*, and look, you can even make Yackson a shitty little drawing! What we're missing however, is the much needed content to satiate your hungry minds and provide enrichment to your mental stimulation. If there's anything in particular you'd like to see me write about, go ahead and let me know in the shiny new suggestion box. I'll *definitely* read it! Point is, I'm pretty happy with how Yackson's World looks and functions. You could even say it matches the vision I had going into this project.

As far as what's next on the agenda, there's still a long road ahead. First and foremost, I'm sure you're all chomping at the bit to see what kind of game I have in store for you. In the words of Nintendo, world famous corporate entity known for their work on planting smiles on your face—*please understand, a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad.* And as far as what you should expect, I'll tell you this much: imagine *Super Smash Bros.* in the form of a tabletop RPG, à la *Dungeons and Dragons.* The game currently exists inside of a spreadsheet, which I've used to play with friends online, and I can't wait until the idea is fully realized within a functional website. For more information, stay tuned.

The only other item on the agenda this month is to do away with the *jitters*. And no, I'm not just talking about the astronomical portion of coffee that the skeleton has consumed by now (we'll need to give him a name soon). Go ahead and navigate around the site, and you'll see what I'm talking about. Things tend to shift around when they load, even if for a brief moment. For the simple minded, sure, the site is good enough. But Yackson settles for nothing less than perfection. I'm looking for a certain quality that I refer to as *polish*, and I'll reinvent the wheel to get there. So sit back while the nanobots polish Yackson's World to perfection, and I'll do my part in writing some content that'll blow your effin' mind.

Lastly, there's one bug in particular that really gets under my skin, and I'm not going to tell you what. In fact, if you can correctly guess the one inconsistency in Yackson's World that keeps me up at night, I'll make you a special V.I.P. placquard right on the frickin' home page. I'll even give you a hint: it has to do with a color. Leave your guesses in the comments below. It'll be the one indicator that someone out there actually visits this dumpster fire of a website. But please do not put your guess in the suggestion box, because all jokes aside, I'm never gonna see it.

Big things accomplished, and bigger things coming. Welcome to Yackson's World!
