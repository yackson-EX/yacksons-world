Alright. Half of my laundry is done, the cats' litter boxes are clean, the website looks halfway competent, and I've just sat down at my computer with an ice cold pouch of PokéJuice. And now comes the question—what the hell is Yackson's World? Well, dear reader, I'll tell you exactly what it is. Yackson's World is a weekend project turned hyper-fixation, and when I emerged from my rumpus room at exactly 4:30 in the morning, the end result was, by no means intentionally, a modern day MySpace page (perhaps GeoCities is more accurate here). My friends would know how annoyingly fitting that is for me.

But to really answer the question, Yackson's World, to me, is a few different things. The first is in the title, for which I paid a whole *three dollars* to represent ever so playfully in the url. And do you know how many McDoubles can be had for that?  \[ not even one, dood... ( ;-;) ]  But the point is, Yackson's World intentionally serves as exactly that; a place on the web in which you can truly exist in the same world that Yackson does. Technology is incredible, indeed!

Secondly, and more honestly, Yackson's World is simply a mechanism through which I can externalize my thoughts. Why spend so much time thinking about things that I love, hate, or find interesting, when I can write about them instead? Some people do this on paper and call it a "journal," but that's not quite my tempo. My preferred method of losing much needed sleep is stitching together a quirky blog with a neat little skeleton in the corner (he loves his coffee). Thus, the goal is not to gain traffic, followers, or any other sort of good-boy-points, but rather to give myself a way to collect my thoughts in a place where they can be a bit more fleshed out. And look, you can even copy and paste them now!

Third and finally, Yackson's World is place in which I can consolidate my art. After all, where else would all of my shitsongs live but in Yackson's World? For those of you who don't know, my ultimate goal is to create a piece of art through every medium that I can. The criteria state that for each medium, there only needs to be at least one project. And it doesn't even have to be good! How easy is that? This is the single item on my bucket list, and realizing Yackson's World brings me one step closer to achieving it. In fact, I would even argue that a blog counts as a medium for art, so I'm going to go ahead and cross that one off right now. Next on the list is a game, which will be an extenstion of this website in due time. Stay tuned for that little masterpiece...

So as far as what you can expect from Yackson's World, I plan to make reviews, share my thoughts, and post my art. If you care for that sort of thing, stick around. Go ahead, bookmark the page. And if you don't, then I'll bet reading this all the way through was a terrible use of free will for you.
